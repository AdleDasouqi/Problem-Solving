<h3 style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Problems and it's solutions</h3>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
    Solving problems is the core of computer science.<br/>
    Programmers must first understand how a human solves a problem, then understand how to translate this <q>algorithm</q><br/>into something a computer can do, and finally how to <q>write</q> the specific syntax
    <em>(required by a computer)</em> to get the job done.
    Computer Programmers are problem solvers. In order to solve a problem on a computer you must:
    <ul style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        <li>
            Know how to represent the information (data) describing the problem.
        </li>
        <li>
            Determine the steps to transform the information from one representation into another.
        </li>
    </ul>

    6 Ways to Improve Your Programming Problem Solving &#129300;
</h2>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
    First, developers need to find a problem they can solve with software.<br/>
    Then, they have to figure out how humans solve that problem.<br/>
    And then, they have to find a way to effectively translate both the problem and the solution<br/>
    into code that a computer can use to solve the problem as well as (or better than) a person.<br/>
    <em>
        And then there are all the problems along the way: Working with teams, 
        finding and fixing bugs, meeting delivery deadlines.
    </em><br/>
    <q>Engineers use problem-solving skills constantly.</q><br/>
</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
    Because of that, if you want to become a better developer, 
    one place to start might be becoming a better problem solver.<br/>
    But that’s easier said than done, and requires a deep understanding of what problem solving is,<br/>
    why it matters, and what it actually takes to improve those skills.
</p>
<h2 style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
    What Is Problem Solving, and Why Does It Matter?
</h2>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
    Problem solving can mean a few different things:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
        <li>
            Creating an application that meets the end user’s goals.
        </li>
        <li>
            Communicating effectively with team members to delegate work.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finding and fixing bugs in the code.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meeting a tight deadline for a client.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<h3 style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
    Why Should Engineers Work On Problem Solving Skills?
</h3>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
   <em>
    <q>Just like any other skill, problem solving takes practice to apply and master.</q>
   </em><br/>
   Many developers think that becoming a better problem solver means being able to solve more problems, faster.<br/>
   But that’s not true, <q>it means being able to find the best solution to a problem, and then put that solution in place.</q>

    6 Ways to Get Better at Problem Solving &#128521;
</h2>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
    You need to practice. A lot. And then practice some more. <span style="font-size: 20px;">&#128336;</span>
    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
        <li>
            Solve a Lot of Problems on a Lot of Different Platforms
        </li>
        <em>
            Solve as many problems as you can, but try to focus on different types 
            of problems on different platforms.
        </em>
        <li>
            Solve Problems in Contexts Other Than Work
        </li>
        <em>
            Since problem solving is a skill that requires practice, 
            you can (and should) work on it even outside of work hours.
        </em>
        <li>
            Learn From Past Solutions, and Apply Them to New Problems
        </li>
        <li>
            Ask Others for Help and Feedback
        </li>
        <li>
            Train the Problem Solving Part of Your Mind
        </li>
        <li>
            Practice Other Skills Related to Problem Solving
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
    <em>
        Problem solving is one of the most necessary skills for developers to have. With time,
        practice, and dedication, they can improve it, constantly, and keep becoming better.
